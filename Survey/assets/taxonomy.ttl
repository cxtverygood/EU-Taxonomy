The area on which the activity takes place is covered by an afforestation plan of a duration of at least five years, or the minimum period prescribed in national law, developed prior to the start of the activity, and continuously updated until this area matches the definition of forest as set out in national law or where not available, is in line with the FAO definition of forest.The afforestation plan contains all elements required by the national law relating to environmental impact assessment of afforestation.1.2. Preferably through the afforestation plan, or if information is missing, through any other document, detailed information is provided on the following points:description of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;site preparation and its impacts on pre-existing carbon stocks, including soils and above-ground biomass, in order to protect land with high carbon stock(8);management goals, including major constraints;general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution;compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;measures deployed to establish and maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risks;assessment of impact on food security;all DNSH criteria relevant to afforestation.1.3. When the area becomes a forest, the afforestation plan is followed by a subsequent forest management plan or an equivalent instrument, as set out in national law or, where national law does not define a forest management plan or equivalent instrument, as referred to in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest management plan’(9). The forest management plan or the equivalent instrument covers a period of 10 years or more and is continuously updated.1.4. Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest management plan or equivalent system:management goals, including major constraints(10);general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution;definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risksall DNSH criteria relevant to forest management.1.5. The activity follows the best afforestation practices laid down in national law, or, where no such best afforestation practices have been laid down in national law, the activity complies with one of the following criteria:the activity complies with Delegated Regulation (EU) No 807/2014;the activity follows the “Pan-European Guidelines for Afforestation and Reforestation with a special focus on the provisions of the UNFCCC”(11).1.6. The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock(12).1.7. The management system associated with the activity in place complies with the due diligence obligation and legality requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010.1.8. The afforestation plan and the subsequent forest management plan or equivalent instrument provides for monitoring that ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area. 2. AuditWithin two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following:the relevant national competent authorities;an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit.The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.3.Group assessmentThe compliance with the DNSH criteria may be checked:at the level of the forest sourcing area(13) level as defined by Directive (EU) 2018/2001; at the level of a group of forest holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits.

The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the following steps: screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks on the economic activity;an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan, such that: for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state of-the-art climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios(3) consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 years climate projections scenarios for major investments.3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports(4), scientific peer-reviewed publications and open source(5) or paying models.4. The adaptation solutions implemented: do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;favour nature-based solutions(6) or rely on blue or green infrastructure(7) to the extent possible; are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those indicators are not met;where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening criteria for that activity.5.

    sml:description "1. Afforestation plan and subsequent forest management plan or equivalent instrument1.1. The area on which the activity takes place is covered by an afforestation plan of a duration of at least five years, or the minimum period prescribed in national law, developed prior to the start of the activity and continuously updated, until this area matches the definition of forest as set out in national law or where not available, is in line with the FAO definition of forest.The afforestation plan contains all elements required by the national law relating to environmental impact assessment of afforestation. 1.2 Preferably through the afforestation plan, or if information is missing, through any other document, detailed information is provided on the following points:description of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;site preparation and its impacts on pre-existing carbon stocks, including soils and above-ground biomass, in order to protect land with high carbon stock(3);management goals, including major constraints;general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution;compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;measures deployed to establish and maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risks;assessment of impact on food security;all DNSH criteria relevant to afforestation.1.3. When the area becomes a forest, the afforestation plan is followed by a subsequent forest management plan or an equivalent instrument, as set out in national law or, where national law does not define a forest management plan or equivalent instrument, as referred to in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest management plan’(4). The forest management plan or the equivalent instrument covers a period of 10 years or more and is continuously updated. 1.4 Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest management plan or equivalent system: management goals, including major constraints(5);general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution;definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risks;all DNSH criteria relevant to forest management.1.5. The activity follows the best afforestation practices laid down in national law, or, where no such best afforestation practices have been laid down in national law, the activity complies with one of the following criteria:the activity complies with Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 807/2014(6);the activity follows the “Pan-European Guidelines for Afforestation and Reforestation with a special focus on the provisions of the UNFCCC”(7).1.6. The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock(8) .1.7. The management system associated with the activity in place complies with the due diligence obligation and legality requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council(9).1.8. The afforestation plan and the subsequent forest management plan or equivalent instrument provide for monitoring that ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.2. Climate benefit analysis2.1. For areas that comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity;long-term climate benefits are considered demonstrated by proof of alignment with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.2.2. For areas that do not comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity.the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to the longer duration between 100 years and the duration of an entire forest cycle.2.3. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria:the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories(10). The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage.the business as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are ones of the following:the management practices as documented in the latest version of the forest management plan or equivalent instrument before the start of the activity, if any; the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity;the practices corresponding to a management system ensuring that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest area are maintained or strengthened over the long term as set out in Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used.emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, forest fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions and removals due to natural disturbances.2.4. Forest holdings under 13ha are not required to perform a climate benefit analysis.3. Guarantee of permanence3.1. In accordance with national law, the forest status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed by one of the following measures:the area is classified in the permanent forest estate as defined by the FAO(11);the area is classified as a protected area;the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a forest.3.2. In accordance with national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the afforestation plan and the subsequent forest management plan or equivalent instrument, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that corresponds to one of the forestry activities defined in this Regulation.4. AuditWithin two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following:the relevant national competent authorities;an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit.The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.5. Group assessmentThe compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria may be checked:at the level of the forest sourcing area(12) as defined in Article 2, point (30), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001; at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits."@en ;

When a pattern of extreme weather persists for some time, such as a season, it may be classed as an extreme climate event, especially if it yields an average or total that is itself extreme (e.g., drought or heavy rainfall over a season).

    sml:description "1. Forest management plan or equivalent instrument1.1. The activity takes place on area that is subject to a forest management plan or an equivalent instrument, as set out in national law or, where national law does not define a forest management plan or equivalent instrument, as referred to in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest management plan’(30).The forest management plan or the equivalent instrument covers a period of 10 years or more, and is continuously updated. 1.2 Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest management plan or equivalent system:management goals, including major constraints(31);general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution;definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risks;all DNSH criteria relevant to forest management.1.3. The sustainability of the forest management systems, as documented in the plan referred to in point 1.1, is ensured by choosing the most ambitious of the following approaches: the forest management matches the applicable national definition of sustainable forest management; the forest management matches the Forest Europe definition(32) of sustainable forest management, and complies with the Pan-European Operational Level Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management(33);the management system in place complies with the forest sustainability criteria laid down in Article 29(6) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and as of the date of its application with the implementing act on operational guidance for energy from forest biomass adopted under Article 29(8) of that Directive.1.4. The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock(34).1.5. The management system associated with the activity in place complies with the due diligence obligation and legality requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010.1.6. The forest management plan or equivalent instrument provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.2. Climate benefit analysis2.1. For areas that comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity;long-term climate benefits are considered demonstrated by proof of alignment with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.2.2. For areas that do not comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity.the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to the longer duration between 100 years and the duration of an entire forest cycle.2.3. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria:the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories(35). The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage.the business-as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following:the management practices as documented in the latest version of the forest management plan or equivalent instrument before the start of the activity, if any;the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity;the practices corresponding to a management system ensuring that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest area are maintained or strengthened over the long term as set out in Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used.emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, forest fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions and removals due to natural disturbances.2.4. Forest holdings under 13ha are not required to perform a climate benefit analysis.3. Guarantee of permanence3.1. In accordance with national law, the forest status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed by one of the following measures:the area is classified in the permanent forest estate as defined by the FAO(36);the area is classified as a protected area;the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a forest.3.2. In accordance with national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the forest management plan or equivalent instrument, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that corresponds to one of the forestry activities defined in this Regulation.4. AuditWithin two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following:the relevant national competent authorities;an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit.The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.5. Group assessmentThe compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria may be checked:at the level of the forest sourcing area(37) as defined in Article 2, point (30), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001; at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits."@en ;

    sml:description "1. Forest management plan or equivalent instrument1.1. The activity takes place on area that is subject to a forest management plan or an equivalent instrument, as set out in national law or, where national law does not define a forest management plan or equivalent instrument, as referred to in the FAO definition of ‘forest area with long-term forest management plan’(40).The forest management plan or equivalent instrument covers a period of 10 years or more and is continuously updated. 1.2. Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest management plan or equivalent system:management goals, including major constraints(41);general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;definition of the forest habitat context, including main existing and intended forest tree species, and their extent and distribution;definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risks;all DNSH criteria relevant for forest management.1.3. The sustainability of the forest management systems, as documented in the plan referred to in point 1.1, is ensured by choosing the most ambitious of the following approaches: the forest management matches the applicable national definition of sustainable forest management; the forest management matches the Forest Europe definition(42) of sustainable forest management, and complies with the Pan-European Operational Level Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management(43);the management system in place shows compliance with the forest sustainability criteria set out in Article 29(6) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and as of the date of its application with the implementing act on operational guidance for energy from forest biomass adopted under Article 29(8) of that Directive.1.4. The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock(44) .1.5. The management system associated with the activity in place complies with the due diligence obligation and legality requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010.1.6. The forest management plan or equivalent instrument provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.2. Climate benefit analysis2.1. For areas that comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity;long-term climate benefits are considered demonstrated by proof of alignment with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.2.2. For areas that do not comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity.the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to the longer duration between 100 years and the duration of an entire forest cycle.2.3. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria:the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories(45). The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage.the business-as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following:the management practices as documented in the latest version of the forest management plan or equivalent instrument before the start of the activity, if any;the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity;the practices corresponding to a management system ensuring that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest area are maintained or strengthened over the long term as set out in Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used.emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, forest fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions and removals due to natural disturbances.2.4. Forest holdings under 13ha are not required to perform a climate benefit analysis.3. Guarantee of permanence3.1. In accordance with national law, the forest status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed by one of the following measures:the area is classified in the permanent forest estate as defined by the FAO(46);the area is classified as a protected area;the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a forest.3.2. In accordance with national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the forest management plan or equivalent instrument, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that corresponds to one of the forestry activities defined in this Regulation. 4. AuditWithin two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria is verified by either of the following:the relevant national competent authorities;an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit.The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.5. Group assessmentThe compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria may be checked:at the level of the forest sourcing area(47) as defined in Article 2, point (30), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001;at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits."@en ;

Information is provided on the following points that are not already documented in the forest management plan or equivalent system:management goals, including major constraints;general strategies and activities planned to reach the management goals, including expected operations over the whole forest cycle;definition of the forest habitat context, main forest tree species and those intended and their extent and distribution, in accordance to the local forest ecosystem context;definition of the area according to its gazetting in the land registry;compartments, roads, rights of way and other public access, physical features including waterways, areas under legal and other restrictions;measures deployed to maintain the good condition of forest ecosystems;consideration of societal issues (including preservation of landscape, consultation of stakeholders in accordance with the terms and conditions laid down in national law);assessment of forest related risks, including forest fires, and pests and diseases outbreaks, with the aim of preventing, reducing and controlling the risks and measures deployed to ensure protection and adaptation against residual risks;all DNSH relevant to forest management.1.3. The forest management plan or the equivalent instrument:shows a primary designated management objective(52) that consists in protection of soil and water(53), conservation of biodiversity(54) or social services(55) based on the FAO definitions;promotes biodiversity-friendly practices that enhance forests’ natural processes;includes an analysis of: impacts and pressures on habitat conservation and diversity of associated habitats;condition of harvesting minimizing soil impacts;other activities that have an impact on conservation objectives, such as hunting and fishing, agricultural, pastoral and forestry activities, industrial, mining, and commercial activities.1.4. The sustainability of the forest management systems as documented in the plan referred to in point 1.1 is ensured by choosing the most ambitious of the following approaches: the forest management matches the national definition of sustainable forest management, if any;the forest management matches the Forest Europe definition(56) of sustainable forest management and complies with the Pan-European Operational Level Guidelines for Sustainable Forest Management(57);the management system in place shows compliance with the forest sustainability criteria as defined in Article 29(6) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001, and as of the date of its application with the implementing act on operational guidance for energy from forest biomass adopted under Article 29(8) of that Directive.1.5 The activity does not involve the degradation of land with high carbon stock(58).1.6. The management system associated with the activity in place complies with the due diligence obligation and legality requirements laid down in Regulation (EU) No 995/2010.1.7. The forest management plan or equivalent instrument provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.2. Climate benefit analysis2.1. For areas that comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity;long-term climate benefits are considered demonstrated by proof of alignment with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.2.2. For areas that do not comply with the requirements at forest sourcing area level to ensure that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest are maintained or strengthened over the long term in accordance with Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 the activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity.the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to the longer duration between 100 years and the duration of an entire forest cycle.2.3. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria:the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories(59). The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage.the business as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following:the management practices as documented in the latest version of the forest management plan or equivalent instrument before the start of the activity, if any;the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity;the practices corresponding to a management system ensuring that carbon stocks and sinks levels in the forest area are maintained or strengthened over the long term as set out in Article 29(7), point (b), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001.the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used.emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, forest fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with the criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions and removals due to natural disturbances.2.4. Forest holdings under 13ha are not required to perform a climate benefit analysis.3. Guarantee of permanence3.1. In accordance with national law, the forest status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed by one of the following measures:the area is classified in the permanent forest estate as defined by the FAO(60) ;the area is classified as a protected area;the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a forest.3.2. In accordance with national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the forest management plan or equivalent instrument, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that corresponds to one of the forestry activities defined in this Regulation. 4. AuditWithin two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following:the relevant national competent authorities;an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit.The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.5. Group assessmentThe compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria may be checked:at the level of the forest sourcing area(61) as defined in Article 2, point (30), of Directive (EU) 2018/2001; at the level of a group of forest holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits."@en ;

    sml:description "1. Leadership in modelling and pricing of climate risks:1.1. The insurance activity uses state-of-the-art modelling techniques that:properly reflect climate change risks;do not only rely on historical trend;integrate forward-looking scenarios. 1.2. The insurer publicly discloses how the climate change risks are considered in the insurance activity.1.3. With the exception of legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums, the insurance activity provides incentives for risk reduction by setting out the (pre)-conditions for the insurance coverage of risk and by acting as a price signal of risk. For the purpose of this point, reduced premiums or deductibles, possibly based on supportive information on existing/possible actions, to policyholders who protect an asset or activity against natural catastrophes damages may be considered an incentive for risk reduction.1.4. After a climate risk event, the insurer provides information on the conditions under which coverage under the insurance activity could be renewed or maintained and in particular the benefits of building better in that context.2. Product design:2.1. Insurance products sold under the insurance activity offer risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by policyholders.For the purpose of this point, where a policyholder has invested in adaptation measures, lower premiums may be considered as a risk-based reward for preventive actions taken by policyholders.By way of derogation from this point, where legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums prevent the insurance or reinsurance company from providing risk-based rewards, insurance products may instead provide to customers measures in relation to an asset, an activity, or people that prevent or protect against natural catastrophes. Such measures may be provided as information or advice to customers on climate risks and preventive measures that customers could take.2.2. The distribution strategy for such products covers measures to ensure that policyholders are informed on the relevance of preventive measures that they could take, for the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage, including any impact of such measures on the insurance coverage or the premium level.3. Innovative insurance coverage solutions:3.1. Insurance products sold under the insurance activity offer coverage for the climate-related perils(671) where the demands and needs of policyholders require so.3.2. Depending on the demands and needs of individual customers, products may include specific risk transfer solutions such as protection against business interruption, contingent business interruption, other non-physical damage-related loss factors, cascading effects and interdependencies of hazards (secondary perils), cascading impacts of interacting natural and technological hazards, critical infrastructure failures.4. Data sharing:4.1. With due regard to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council(672), a significant share of loss data related to insurer’s activity is made available, free of charge, to one or several public authorities for the purpose of analytical research. Those public authorities declare to use the data for purposes of enhancing adaptation to climate change by the society in a region, country or internationally and the insurer provides the data at a level of granularity sufficient for the use declared by the respective public authorities.4.2. Where the insurer is not yet sharing such data with a public authority for the aforementioned purpose, it has declared the intention to make its data available, free of charge, to interested third parties and has indicated under which conditions such data can be shared. That declaration of intention to share available data is easily accessible, including on the insurer’s website, for relevant public authorities.5. High level of service in post-disaster situation:Claims under insurance activity, both ongoing and those from large-scale loss events resulting from climate risks, are processed fairly with respect to customers, in accordance with high handling standards for claims and in timely fashion in line with applicable law and there has been no failure to do so in the context of recent large-scale loss events.

The reinsurance activity uses state-of-the-art modelling techniques that:are used to properly reflect in the premium level the exposure, hazard and vulnerability to climate change risks as well as actions taken by the policyholder of the insurer to protect the insured asset or activity against those risks, where such information is provided by the insurer to the reinsurer;do not only rely on historical trends;integrate forward-looking scenarios.1.2. The reinsurer discloses publicly how the risks stemming from climate-related perils are considered in the reinsurance activity.2. Supporting development and supply of enabling non-life reinsurance products:2.1. The reinsurance activity’s underlying products cover risks stemming from climate-related perils and reward, in a risk-based manner and without prejudice to legal restrictions on contractual conditions and insurance premiums, preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders.2.2. The reinsurance activity complies with one or more of the following criteria:where desired by the insurer, the reinsurer engages with the insurer, either directly or via a reinsurance intermediary, during the development of the underlying product by:discussing possible reinsurance solutions that the reinsurer is willing to offer in relation to that product. The final product is brought to market using one of the reinsurance solutions that were discussed with the reinsurer during the product development phase;providing data or other technical advice enabling the insurer to price the coverage for risks stemming from climate-related perils as well as risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders;the insurer would likely reduce or discontinue its coverage under the underlying product without the reinsurance agreement or a comparable reinsurance agreement in place;the reinsurer provides, as part of the business relationship with the insurer or the reinsurance intermediary, data or other technical advice or both enabling the insurer to offer coverage of risks stemming from climate-related perils and the coverage allows for risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders.2.3. Where a reinsurance product applies at the level of a portfolio of underlying products, only a share of the reinsurance activity’s underlying products may cover risks stemming from climate- related perils and reward, in a risk-based manner, preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders for the purpose of point 2.1. In that case, the reinsurer is able to identify the share of reinsurance premiums that relate to those underlying products.3. Innovative reinsurance coverage solutions:3.1. Reinsurance products sold under the reinsurance activity offer coverage for risks stemming from climate-related perils where the demands and needs of the insurer’s clients, based on the underlying products, require so. Such insurance products appropriately reflect risk-based rewards for preventive actions taken by the insurer’s policyholders.3.2.

The restoration plan contains careful consideration of local hydrological and pedological conditions, including the dynamics of soil saturation and the change of aerobic and anaerobic conditions.1.3. All wetland management relevant DNSH criteria are addressed in the restoration plan.1.4. The restoration plan provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area. 2. AuditWithin two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and with the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following:the relevant national competent authorities;an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit.The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.Group assessmentThe compliance with the DNSH criteria may be checked at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits."@en ;

    sml:description "1.	Restoration plan1.1. The area is covered by a restoration plan, which is consistent with the Ramsar Convention’s principles and guidelines on wetland restoration(69), until the area is classified as a wetland and is covered by a wetland management plan, consistent with the Ramsar Convention’s guidelines for management planning for Ramsar sites and other wetlands(70). For peatlands, the restoration plan follows the recommendations contained in relevant resolutions of the Ramsar Convention, including the resolution XIII/13.1.2. The restoration plan contains careful consideration of local hydrological and pedological conditions, including the dynamics of soil saturation and the change of aerobic and anaerobic conditions.1.3. All wetland management relevant DNSH criteria are addressed in the restoration plan.1.4. The restoration plan provides for monitoring which ensures the correctness of the information contained in the plan, in particular as regards the data relating to the involved area.2.	Climate benefit analysis2.1. The activity complies with the following criteria:the climate benefit analysis demonstrates that the net balance of GHG emissions and removals generated by the activity over a period of 30 years after the beginning of the activity is lower than a baseline, corresponding to the balance of GHG emissions and removals over a period of 30 years starting at the beginning of the activity, associated to the business-as-usual practices that would have occurred on the involved area in the absence of the activity;the projected long-term average net GHG balance of the activity is lower than the long-term average GHG balance projected for the baseline, referred to in point 2.2, where long term corresponds to 100 years.2.2. The calculation of climate benefit complies with all of the following criteria:the analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories(71). In particular, if the wetland definition used in that analysis differs from the wetland definition used in the national GHG inventory, the analysis includes an identification of the different land categories covered by the involved area. The climate benefit analysis is based on transparent, accurate, consistent, complete and comparable information, covers all carbon pools impacted by the activity, including above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, deadwood, litter and soil, relies on the most conservative assumptions for calculations and includes appropriate considerations about the risks of non-permanence and reversals of carbon sequestration, the risk of saturation and the risk of leakage. For coastal wetlands, climate benefit analysis considers projections of expected relative sea level rise and the potential that the wetlands will migrate;the business-as-usual practices, including harvesting practices, are one of the following:the management practices as documented before the start of the activity, if any;the most recent business-as-usual practices prior to the start of the activity.the resolution of the analysis is proportionate to the size of the area concerned and values specific to the area concerned are used;emissions and removals that occur due to natural disturbances, such as pests and diseases infestations, fires, wind, storm damages, that impact the area and cause underperformance do not result in non-compliance with the criteria of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, provided that the climate benefit analysis is consistent with the 2019 Refinement to the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories regarding emissions and removals due to natural disturbances.4. Guarantee of permanence4.1. In accordance with national law, the wetland status of the area in which the activity takes place is guaranteed by one of the following measures:the area is designated to be retained as wetland and may not be converted to other land use; the area is classified as a protected area;the area is the subject of any legal or contractual guarantee ensuring that it will remain a wetland.4.2. In accordance with the national law, the operator of the activity commits that future updates to the restoration plan, beyond the activity that is financed, will continue to seek the climate benefits as determined in point 2. Besides, the operator of the activity commits to compensate any reduction in the climate benefit determined in point 2 with an equivalent climate benefit resulting from the conduct of an activity that corresponds to one of the environmental protection and restoration activities defined in this Regulation.5. AuditWithin two years after the beginning of the activity and every 10 years thereafter, the compliance of the activity with the substantial contribution to climate change mitigation criteria and with the DNSH criteria are verified by either of the following:the relevant national competent authorities;an independent third-party certifier, at the request of national authorities or the operator of the activity.In order to reduce costs, audits may be performed together with any forest certification, climate certification or other audit.The independent third-party certifier may not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and may not be involved in the development or operation of the activity.6. Group assessmentThe compliance with the criteria for substantial contribution to climate change mitigation and with DNSH criteria may be checked at the level of a group of holdings sufficiently homogeneous to evaluate the risk of the sustainability of the forest activity, provided that all those holdings have a durable relationship between them and participate in the activity and the group of those holdings remains the same for all subsequent audits."@en ;

The life-cycle GHG emissions from the co-generation of heat/cool and power(192) from renewable gaseous and liquid fuels are lower than 100gCO2e per 1 kWh of energy output from the co-generation. Life-cycle GHG emissions are calculated based on project-specific data, where available, using Recommendation 2013/179/EU or, alternatively, using ISO 14067:2018(193) or ISO 14064-1:2018(194).Quantified life-cycle GHG emissions are verified by an independent third party.2. Where facilities incorporate any form of abatement (including carbon capture or use of decarbonised fuels) that abatement activity complies with the relevant Sections of this Annex, where applicable.Where the CO2 that would otherwise be emitted from the cogeneration process is captured for the purpose of underground storage, the CO2 is transported and stored underground, in accordance with the technical screening criteria set out in Sections 5.11 and 5.12 of this Annex. 3. The activity meets either of the following criteria:at construction, measurement equipment for monitoring of physical emissions, such as methane leakage is installed or a leak detection and repair program is introduced;at operation, physical measurement of methane emissions are reported and leak is eliminated.4. Where the activity blends renewable gaseous or liquid fuels with biogas or bioliquids, the agricultural biomass used for the production of the biogas or bioliquids complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 2 to 5, of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 while forest biomass complies with the criteria laid down in Article 29, paragraphs 6 and 7, of that Directive."@en ;

The independent third-party verifier has the necessary resources and expertise to perform such verification. The independent third party verifier does not have any conflict of interest with the owner or the funder, and is not involved in the development or operation of the activity. The independent third party verifier carries out diligently the verification of compliance with the technical screening criteria. In particular, every year the independent third party publishes and transmits to the Commission a report:certifying the level of direct GHG emissions referred to in point 1(b)(i);where applicable, assessing whether annual direct GHG emissions of the activity are on a credible trajectory to comply with the average threshold over 20 years referred to in point 1(b)(i);assessing whether the activity is on a credible trajectory to comply with point 1(b)(v). When undertaking the assessment referred to in point 1(b), the independent third party verifier takes into account in particular the planned annual direct GHG emissions for each year of the trajectory, realised annual direct GHG emissions, planned and realised operating hours, and planned and realised use of renewable or low carbon gases.On the basis of the reports transmitted to it, the Commission may address an opinion to the relevant operators. The Commission shall take those reports into account when performing the review referred to in Article 19(5) of Regulation (EU) 2020/852.2. The activity meets either of the following criteria:(a) at construction, measurement equipment for monitoring of physical emissions, such as those from methane leakage, is installed or a leak detection and repair programme is introduced;(b) at operation, physical measurement of emissions are reported and leak is eliminated.3.

For operation of existing hydropower plants, including refurbishment activities to enhance renewable energy or energy storage potential, the activity complies with the following criteria:2.1. In accordance with Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular Articles 4 and 11 of that Directive, all technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures have been implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water.2.2. Measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies: measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of-the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning);measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow;measures to protect or enhance habitats.2.3. The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body.3. For construction of new hydropower plants, the activity complies with the following criteria:3.1. In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses in particular the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin.3.2. On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the plant is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements: the plant does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to;where the plant risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following:the reasons of overriding public interest or the fact that benefits expected from the planned hydropower plant outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to society;the fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the plant cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as refurbishing of existing hydropower plants or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity).3.3. All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water.Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies:measures to ensure downstream and upstream fish migration (such as fish friendly turbines, fish guidance structures, state-of the-art fully functional fish passes, measures to stop or minimise operation and discharges during migration or spawning);measures to ensure minimum ecological flow (including mitigation of rapid, short-term variations in flow or hydro-peaking operations) and sediment flow;measures to protect or enhance habitats.The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body.3.4. The plant does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district.3.5. In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not increase the fragmentation of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned hydropower plant may cause.

The transmission and distribution infrastructure or equipment is in an electricity system that complies with at least one of the following criteria:the system is the interconnected European system, i.e. the interconnected control areas of Member States, Norway, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, and its subordinated systems;more than 67% of newly enabled generation capacity in the system is below the generation threshold value of 100 gCO2e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria, over a rolling five-year period;the average system grid emissions factor, calculated as the total annual emissions from power generation connected to the system, divided by the total annual net electricity production in that system, is below the threshold value of 100 gCO2e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis in accordance with electricity generation criteria, over a rolling five-year period;Infrastructure dedicated to creating a direct connection or expanding an existing direct connection between a substation or network and a power production plant that is more greenhouse gas intensive than 100 gCO2e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis is not compliant.Installation of metering infrastructure that does not meet the requirements of smart metering systems of Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2019/944 is not compliant.2. The activity is one of the following:construction and operation of direct connection, or expansion of existing direct connection, of low carbon electricity generation below the threshold of 100 gCO2e/kWh measured on a life cycle basis to a substation or network;construction and operation of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations and supporting electric infrastructure for the electrification of transport, subject to compliance with the technical screening criteria under the transport Section of this Annex;installation of transmission and distribution transformers that comply with the Tier 2 (1 July 2021) requirements set out in Annex I to the Commission Regulation (EU) No 548/2014(178) and, for medium power transformers with highest voltage for equipment not exceeding 36 kV, with AAA0 level requirements on no-load losses set out in standard EN 50588-1(179). construction/installation and operation of equipment and infrastructure where the main objective is an increase of the generation or use of renewable electricity generation;installation of equipment to increase the controllability and observability of the electricity system and to enable the development and integration of renewable energy sources, including: sensors and measurement tools (including meteorological sensors for forecasting renewable production);communication and control (including advanced software and control rooms, automation of substations or feeders, and voltage control capabilities to adapt to more decentralised renewable infeed).installation of equipment such as, but not limited to future smart metering systems or those replacing smart metering systems in line with Article 19(6) of Directive (EU) 2019/944 of the European Parliament and of the Council(180), which meet the requirements of Article 20 of Directive (EU) 2019/944, able to carry information to users for remotely acting on consumption, including customer data hubs;construction/installation of equipment to allow for exchange of specifically renewable electricity between users;construction and operation of interconnectors between transmission systems, provided that one of the systems is compliant.For the purposes of this Section, the following specifications apply:the rolling five-year period used in determining compliance with the thresholds is based on five consecutive historical years, including the year for which the most recent data are available;a ‘system’ means the power control area of the transmission or distribution network where the infrastructure or equipment is installed;transmission systems may include generation capacity connected to subordinated distribution systems;distribution systems subordinated to a transmission system that is deemed to be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation may also be deemed to be on a trajectory to full decarbonisation;to determine compliance, it is possible to consider a system covering multiple control areas which are interconnected and with significant energy exchanges between them, in which case the weighted average emissions factor across all included control areas is used, and individual subordinated transmission or distribution systems within that system is not required to demonstrate compliance separately;it is possible for a system to become non-compliant after having previously been compliant. In systems that become non-compliant, no new transmission and distribution activities are compliant from that moment onward, until the system complies again with the threshold (except for those activities that are always compliant, see above). Activities in subordinated systems may still be compliant, where those subordinated systems meet the criteria of this Section;a direct connection or expansion of an existing direct connection to production plants includes infrastructure that is indispensable to carry the associated electricity from the power generating facility to a substation or to the network."@en ;

In accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC and in particular paragraph 7 of that Article, prior to refurbishment/construction, an impact assessment of the project is carried out to assess all its potential impacts on the status of water bodies within the same river basin and on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water, considering in particular migration corridors, free-flowing rivers or ecosystems close to undisturbed conditions. The assessment is based on recent, comprehensive and accurate data, including monitoring data on biological quality elements that are specifically sensitive to hydromorphological alterations, and on the expected status of the water body as a result of the new activities, as compared to its current one. It assesses, in particular, the cumulated impacts of this new project with other existing or planned infrastructure in the river basin.On the basis of that impact assessment, it has been established that the project is conceived, by design and location and by mitigation measures, so that it complies with one of the following requirements:the project does not entail any deterioration nor compromises the achievement of good status or potential of the specific water body it relates to, where the project risks to deteriorate or compromise the achievement of good status/potential of the specific water body it relates to, such deterioration is not significant, and is justified by a detailed cost-benefit assessment demonstrating both of the following: the overriding reasons in the public interest or the fact that the benefits expected from the planned navigation infrastructure project in terms of benefits to climate change mitigation/adaptation outweigh the costs from deteriorating the status of water that are accruing to the environment and to societythe fact that the overriding public interest or the benefits expected from the activity cannot, for reasons of technical feasibility or disproportionate cost, be achieved by alternative means that would lead to a better environmental outcome (such as nature based solution, alternative location, rehabilitation/refurbishment of existing infrastructures, or use of technologies not disrupting river continuity). All technically feasible and ecologically relevant mitigation measures are implemented to reduce adverse impacts on water as well as on protected habitats and species directly dependent on water.Mitigation measures include, where relevant and depending on the ecosystems naturally present in the affected water bodies:measures to ensure conditions as close as possible to undisturbed continuity (including measures to ensure longitudinal and lateral continuity, minimum ecological flow and sediment flow); measures to protect or enhance morphological conditions and habitats for aquatic species;measures to reduce adverse impacts of eutrophication.The effectiveness of those measures is monitored in the context of the authorisation or permit setting out the conditions aimed at achieving good status or potential of the affected water body.The project does not permanently compromise the achievement of good status/potential in any of the water bodies in the same river basin district.In addition to the mitigation measures referred to above, and where relevant, compensatory measures are implemented to ensure that the project does not result in overall deterioration of status of water bodies in the same river basin district. This is achieved by restoring (longitudinal or lateral) continuity within the same river basin district to an extent that compensates the disruption of continuity, which the planned navigation infrastructure project may cause. Compensation starts prior to the execution of the project."@en ;

The economic activity has implemented physical and non-physical solutions (‘adaptation solutions’) that substantially reduce the most important physical climate risks that are material to that activity.2. The physical climate risks that are material to the activity have been identified from those listed in Appendix A to this Annex by performing a robust climate risk and vulnerability assessment with the following steps:screening of the activity to identify which physical climate risks from the list in Appendix A to this Annex may affect the performance of the economic activity during its expected lifetime;where the activity is assessed to be at risk from one or more of the physical climate risks listed in Appendix A to this Annex, a climate risk and vulnerability assessment to assess the materiality of the physical climate risks on the economic activity;an assessment of adaptation solutions that can reduce the identified physical climate risk.The climate risk and vulnerability assessment is proportionate to the scale of the activity and its expected lifespan, such that: for activities with an expected lifespan of less than 10 years, the assessment is performed, at least by using climate projections at the smallest appropriate scale;for all other activities, the assessment is performed using the highest available resolution, state-of-the-art climate projections across the existing range of future scenarios(661) consistent with the expected lifetime of the activity, including, at least, 10 to 30 year climate projections scenarios for major investments. 3. The climate projections and assessment of impacts are based on best practice and available guidance and take into account the state-of-the-art science for vulnerability and risk analysis and related methodologies in line with the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports(662), scientific peer-reviewed publications and open source(663) or paying models.4. The adaptation solutions implemented:do not adversely affect the adaptation efforts or the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;favour nature-based solutions(664) or rely on blue or green infrastructure(665) to the extent possible;are consistent with local, sectoral, regional or national adaptation plans and strategies;are monitored and measured against pre-defined indicators and remedial action is considered where those indicators are not met;where the solution implemented is physical and consists in an activity for which technical screening criteria have been specified in this Annex, the solution complies with the do no significant harm technical screening criteria for that activity.5. In order for an activity to be considered as an enabling activity as referred to in Article 11(1), point (b), of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, the economic operator demonstrates, through an assessment of current and future climate risks, including uncertainty and based on robust data, that the activity provides a technology, product, service, information, or practice, or promotes their uses with one of the following primary objectives: increasing the level of resilience to physical climate risks of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities;contributing to adaptation efforts of other people, of nature, of cultural heritage, of assets and of other economic activities."@en ;
