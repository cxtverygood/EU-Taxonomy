    "# EU Taxonomy Ontology Generation Pipeline \n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is an automated ontology construction tool designed to encode the **EU taxonomy of sustainable activities** into a semantically structured, machine-readable format. The primary function of this tool is to process structured data from Excel spreadsheets, detailing economic activities and their sustainability criteria related to climate adaptation and mitigation, and convert this information into **RDF (Resource Description Framework) triples**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to parsing the data, we leverage the **ChatGPT API** to intelligently extract nuanced information from free-text descriptions within the spreadsheets. This involves identifying and extracting references to external resources and any limitations that qualify an activity's sustainability credentials. These extracted elements are then meticulously added to the ontology, enriching the taxonomy with detailed context and constraints that define sustainable practices within each activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The resulting ontology not only categorizes activities within their respective sectors but also provides an intricate web of information that users can navigate to understand the sustainability landscape of the EU's economic activities. This notebook **streamlines the transformation from raw data to a comprehensive ontology**, ensuring a robust and navigable dataset for stakeholders engaged in sustainable finance."
